  - Basic UI Done that includes buttons to "send" requests (just test it with a print statement or smth for now)
  - Basic UI for Admins that let's the user select Security Level, Tags, the Item Name, and Upload an Image.  Save the image in local directory and store all of things either in a list or as individual data
  ✔ SQL Table Written and Organized (What columns)
  ✔ Test adding things in along with testing of basic SQL statements
